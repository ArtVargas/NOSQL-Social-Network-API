# NOSQL-Social-Network-API
This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The social network application utilizes all the necessary learned information from the lectures presented in class and is then used to demonstrate various thoughts that cause a reactive interaction. The interactions are able to allow the user to express their thoughts which are then interactable with other friends' thoughts which can then be used to create a friend list. All the technical applications and skills utilize Express.js for routing while also creating and using a MondoDB database. This also includes using a Mongoose ODM which is applied for further demonstration of accurate technical capability when creating API social networking web applications. This challenge proved to be quite challenging and fascinating as it embodied a lot of research. Lots of topics and information that was discovered all became new ground and really provided further gain of knowledge that was not accessed before most notably the topic of understanding various thought and reaction components. This project stands apart on its own due to being a first time attempt at using an API build for social networking applications that contain various thought expression implementation, thought reaction, and friend list creation.
